1. These are the steps which I structure my project:
   1.1 Creating the books objects with three books inside.

   1.2 Grabing elements which are useful.

   1.3 Copy the books object (using spread operaator).

   1.4 Map through the object and create new html and then join them together.

2. If I had more time, I would make the checkbox and the delete button work properly.

3. Yes. I learnt something new while working on this project: 

    **table**: I tried to use table in my new html with some rows and add the new book row every time I fill the input and click the button add. So started then, I know that we can add table row as much we want.

4. For me, the most challenging part is the use of local storage and listen to a button with svg inside.

5. Yes, please. If it is possible, I want more explanation about the topic.

6. Any way, It was so nice project and it is good to solve different problem in a project so that we learn new thing every time and I think we will be able to solve them next time.
